This is a tool made for the roblox [doors](https://www.roblox.com/games/6516141723/DOORS) game.

In this game there is a specific entity that requires you to stop moving. This tool opens a popup whenever it detects that enemy to help people with a slow reaction time.

The popup stays open for 4 seconds, you should re-click manually on the game when the entity has passed.

This script has a monitor on which you can see which screen is being monitored. Closing this does not stop the app.

To test whether it works, open [this image](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/a9C1KfuIYuw/maxresdefault.jpg) and [this image](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0MYnjk4eASw/hqdefault.jpg) with the tool active.

To close the app, click the quit button on the popup that you get when you see the entity (which is why there are 2 images linked above) or close the terminal where you ran the python script.


This script is not manually coded by me, it is made with AI tools and edited / corrected by me.
